# Java Basics

This was created as a learning tool and as something to possibly reference back to when working with Java. If run "as-is" it will only demonstrate some basic functionality of "enum". 

## Code
This code is messy as I combined roughly a dozen or so concepts into one long program. The main bulk of "App.java" is commented out and each section is separated by a comment block similar to:

``
//@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
``


### Setup:
I created this in Visual Studio Code utilizing Maven. This program runs on Java 1.7

#### Description:
I made this program to learn the fundamentals of Java, it covers the following topics:

Variables and Data Types, Basic Operators, Input and Scanners, Conditions and Booleans, If/Else/Else If, Nested Statements, Arrays, For Loops, While Loops, Sets and Lists, Maps and HashMaps, Objects, Creating/Using Classes, Inheritance, STATIC examples, Overloading Methods and Object Comparisons, Inner Classes, Interfaces, Enums

## App.java:
This is the main file that this program uses. It (at some point) calls on classes/objects from all the other .java files in the "test_main" directory.
